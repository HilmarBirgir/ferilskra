Through its lifetime it has gotten over 50 million downloads on iOS and reached #1 in the Apple App Store of 136 countries. I was employee number 6 and after the company started to grow I took on the role of leading our iOS discipline which included 7 developers at its largest. My responsibilities as iOS lead included interviewing, hiring and training employees and leading our overall iOS architecture. Our iOS mantra is test and automate everything. We have over 6000 unit tests that run in under a minute and fully automated pipelines (using fastlane) for testing, distributing test builds and submitting to the App Store. The app is mostly Objective-C but all new code is now written in Swift.",
