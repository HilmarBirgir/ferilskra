I joined the company in the very beginning. I was employee number 6. After the company started to grow I took on the role of leading our iOS discipline which included 7 developers at its largest. My responsibilities as iOS lead included interviewing, hiring and training employees and leading our overall iOS architecture.   Our iOS mantra is test and automate everything. We have over 6000 unit tests and fully automated pipelines for testing, distributing test builds and submitting to the app store. All using fastlane. The app is mostly Objective C but all new code is now written in Swift.",
